Some recommendation include:

- **Continued Market Research**: Despite the success, continuous market research will help anticipate any shifts in consumer behavior, market demand, or emergent competitors.

- **Sales Training**: Given the variation in performance among sales representatives, additional training or sharing of best practices could help level the playing field.

- **Expand Geographically**: The current revenue distribution shows a strong focus on Europe. Exploring other geographical markets might offer additional growth opportunities and brand expansion.
